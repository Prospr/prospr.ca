## Grow Your Website.

This is our site! We're glad you're peeking. Hopefully, you like what you see.
Founded in 2013, Prospr helps small businesses in Toronto grow their online presence.
A lot of web design firms cut corners and costs to get you a boilerplate website up and running quickly.
At Prospr, we know that your site is the face of your business. We take the time and have the expertise necessary to build you a strong and future-ready site
that not only looks good, but performs well too - for years to come.

There's no hoodoo magic here, we want to make sure our clients always know what we're doing and why. Always ask us questions, we'll be happy to answer.

Over the course of a project, you'll have lots of involvement with the process. Access to our Dropbox, another GitHub repository similar to this one (but private), 
and our Google Drive. Everything we do, you see. You hear that? It's the sound of a beautiful friendship based on trust being born.

Feel free to poke around this repository. We've got nothing to hide. Except those hashed passwords in the user files.

Thanks for reading. Live Long & Prospr.

##Cloning, Branching & Playing Around

Prospr.ca uses Grunt to automate those boring tasks you hate. We also use Sass, Compass, and Susy to make our CSS awesome.

Grunt works on Node.js - Get the installer [here](http://nodejs.org/)

Sass works on Ruby - Get the installer [here](http://rubyinstaller.org/)

Once you've got Ruby & Node.js installed, do the following:

'gem install sass'

'gem install compass'

'gem install susy'

Then, navigate the the _themes/prospr/ directory and enter:

'npm install'

Finally, run the 'grunt' command. This will watch for changes in the files and activate the appropriate stuff.
It'll even refresh the browser window if you're running on a local server. Cool.

Happy fiddling!
